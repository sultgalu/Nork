Program Events: Before/After Render, OnNewFrame -> camera canContr. can update it's VP on this.
Store VP (with any other common render data) in ubo. Need Render Api (like lightStorage) for this stuff
	-> Need separate (from win's) eventMan for these, events need to get called on raising (frameEventMan or smt)
	-> OR add method SubscribeForImmadiate() and have to sep. func. vectors

Make Event Categories. eg. WindowClose should not be INPUT. 
	-> Make EventManager templated by these categories
CameraController will need a parameter that has AppEvents, so it can listen to onUpdate().
	Or make onUpdate() method and call from outside?
